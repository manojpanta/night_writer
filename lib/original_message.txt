When it comes at me in the mirror with its meaning
ramping up until it passes and lowers in pitch, I'm on
the bit of the M where it bisects the Ring of Gullion

and I switch lanes, and let my right foot alleviate
its weight on the accelerator of the Focus,
and the ambulance is faster, and the shift in its report

an effect of the change in the wave's frequency
and length on the observer, who is, in this case, me,
heading up to Newry hospice off the redeye,
